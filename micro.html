              Innovative security system powered by a microcontroller, utilizing both an LDR sensor and laser technology. While the concept of laser-based security systems is not new, our solution offers a unique twist. We've enhanced traditional single-laser line setups by incorporating a series of strategically placed small mirrors. These mirrors scatter the laser beams, creating a dynamic laser wall that blankets the protected area. Any intrusion that disrupts this laser shield triggers the system, alerting you to potential threats. With this advanced approach, we've elevated security to a new level, providing comprehensive protection against unauthorized access.

System combines the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensors with the BMP280 barometric pressure sensor to create a comprehensive fall detection solution. By continuously monitoring motion and environmental factors, such as pressure changes, the system can accurately detect falls in real-time.

Healthcare Application:
In healthcare settings, our fall detection system plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and well-being of patients, particularly the elderly or individuals with mobility impairments. Falls are a common and serious concern in healthcare facilities, often leading to injuries and complications. By promptly detecting falls, healthcare providers can intervene quickly, reducing the risk of serious injury and improving patient outcomes. Additionally, the system can provide valuable data for healthcare professionals to analyze fall patterns, identify high-risk individuals, and implement preventive measures to mitigate future incidents. Overall, our fall detection system enhances patient safety, promotes proactive care, and contributes to a safer healthcare environment.

             I developed a motion detection system utilizing an IR sensor strategically placed near the eye on glasses frames. This setup enables the detection of eye motion, particularly prolonged eye closure indicative of sleep. When the system detects extended periods of closed eyes, it triggers an alarm, serving as a reliable alert mechanism to prevent unintentional sleep and ensure vigilance in critical situations.
